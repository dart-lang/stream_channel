/// An abstract class representing a two-way communication channel.
///
/// Users should consider the [stream] emitting a "done" event to be the
/// canonical indicator that the channel has closed. If they wish to close the
/// channel, they should close the [sink]â€”canceling the stream subscription is
/// not sufficient. Protocol errors may be emitted through the stream or through
/// [sink].done, depending on their underlying cause. Note that the sink may
/// silently drop events if the channel closes before [sink].close is called.
///
/// Implementations are strongly encouraged to mix in or extend
/// [StreamChannelMixin] to get default implementations of the various instance
/// methods. Adding new methods to this interface will not be considered a
/// breaking change if implementations are also added to [StreamChannelMixin].
///
/// Implementations must provide the following guarantees:
///
/// * The stream is single-subscription, and must follow all the guarantees of
///   single-subscription streams.
///
/// * Closing the sink causes the stream to close before it emits any more
///   events.
///
/// * After the stream closes, the sink is automatically closed. If this
///   happens, sink methods should silently drop their arguments until
///   [sink].close is called.
///
/// * If the stream closes before it has a listener, the sink should silently
///   drop events if possible.
///
/// * Canceling the stream's subscription has no effect on the sink. The channel
///   must still be able to respond to the other endpoint closing the channel
///   even after the subscription has been canceled.
///
/// * The sink *either* forwards errors to the other endpoint *or* closes as
///   soon as an error is added and forwards that error to the [sink].done
///   future.
///
/// These guarantees allow users to interact uniformly with all implementations,
/// and ensure that either endpoint closing the stream produces consistent
/// behavior.

/// A class that multiplexes multiple virtual channels across a single
/// underlying transport layer.
///
/// This should be connected to another [MultiChannel] on the other end of the
/// underlying channel. It starts with a single default virtual channel,
/// accessible via [stream] and [sink]. Additional virtual channels can be
/// created with [virtualChannel].
///
/// When a virtual channel is created by one endpoint, the other must connect to
/// it before messages may be sent through it. The first endpoint passes its
/// [VirtualChannel.id] to the second, which then creates a channel from that id
/// also using [virtualChannel]. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// // First endpoint
/// var virtual = multiChannel.virtualChannel();
/// multiChannel.sink.add({
///   "channel": virtual.id
/// });
///
/// // Second endpoint
/// multiChannel.stream.listen((message) {
///   var virtual = multiChannel.virtualChannel(message["channel"]);
///   // ...
/// });
/// ```
///
/// Sending errors across a [MultiChannel] is not supported. Any errors from the
/// underlying stream will be reported only via the default
/// [MultiChannel.stream].
///
/// Each virtual channel may be closed individually. When all of them are
/// closed, the underlying [StreamSink] is closed automatically.

  /// [stream] will close, but other virtual channels will remain open and new

  /// the remote endpoint or a reply on a channel that originated in the local
  /// endpoint.

  /// endpoint, the channel's id plus one is used. This way each [MultiChannel]
